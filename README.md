# Using git
- Ensure git is installed
    - `git --version`
    - If needed, download git or git-for-windows
- Ask me to add you to the contributors in github if needed
- Download the code to your computer
    - cd to the directory which will hold the project (cd ~\source\repos)
    - `git clone https://github.com/dstbstr/DrandallCode`
- Create a branch to work in
    - git branch myName/myFeature (`git branch durandal/creatingTests`)
    - git checkout myName/myFeature (`git checkout durandal/creatingTests`)
- Write your amazing code
- Save your changes to git
    - See what git thinks it's going to add
    - `git status`
    - If everything looks right
        - `git add -A`
    - Otherwise
        - `git add someFile.cpp`
        - Or update the .gitignore if it should never include this type of file
    - Save your changes locally
    - `git commit -m "My useful commit message here"`
- Get ready to merge
    - `git checkout main`
        - If there are problems, ensure that everything is committed or reverted
        - Optionally look at `git stash`
    - Pull down the latest version of main
    - `git pull`
        - if main is already up to date, you should be able to stop here
    - Switch back to your branch
    - `git checkout myName/myFeature`
    - Merge the changes from main into your stuff
    - `git merge main`
        - Resolve any conflicts
    - Commit the merge
    - `git add -A`
    - `git commit -m "Merged with main"`
- Push your changes to remote
    - Until now, everything only exists on your computer
    - To tell github about it
    - `git push -u origin myName/myFeature`
    - after the first push of a branch to remote, the command can be simplified to
    - `git push`
- Merge into main
  - If everything looks right, we'll do the opposite of what we did before
  - `git checkout main`
  - `git merge myName/MyFeature`
  - `git add -A`
  - `git push`
